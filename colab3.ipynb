    "## Creating Our Own Message Passing Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's start implementing our own message passing layers! Working through this part will help us become acutely familiar with the behind the scenes work of implementing Pytorch Message Passing Layers, allowing us to build our own GNN models. To do so, we will work with and implement 3 critcal functions needed to define a PyG Message Passing Layer: `forward`, `message`, and `aggregate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving head first into the coding details, let us quickly review the key components of the message passing process. To do so, we will focus on a single round of messsage passing with respect to a single central node $x$. Before message passing, $x$ is associated with a feature vector $x^{l-1}$, and the goal of message passing is to update this feature vector as $x^l$. To do so, we implement the following steps: 1) each neighboring node $v$ passes its current message $v^{l-1}$ across the edge $(x, v)$ - 2) for the node $x$, we aggregate all of the messages of the neighboring nodes (for example through a sum or mean) - and 3) we transform the aggregated information by for example applying linear and non-linear transformations. Altogether, the message passing process is applied such that every node $u$ in our graph updates its embedding by acting as the central node $x$ in step 1-3 described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we extending this process to that of a single message passing layer, the job of a message passing layer is to update the current feature representation or embedding of each node in a graph by propagating and transforming information within the graph. Overall, the general paradigm of a message passing layers is: 1) pre-processing -> 2) **message passing** / propagation -> 3) post-processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `forward` fuction that we will implement for our message passing layer captures this execution logic. Namely, the `forward` function handles the pre and post-processing of node features / embeddings, as well as initiates message passing by calling the `propagate` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `propagate` function encapsulates the message passing process! It does so by calling three important functions: 1) `message`, 2) `aggregate`, and 3) `update`. Our implementation will vary slightly from this, as we will not explicitly implement `update`, but instead place the logic for updating node embeddings after message passing and within the `forward` function. To be more specific, after information is propagated (message passing), we can further transform the node embeddings outputed by `propagate`. Therefore, the output of `forward` is exactly the node embeddings after one GNN layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, before starting to implement our own layer, let us dig a bit deeper into each of the functions described above:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def propagate(edge_index, x=(x_i, x_j), extra=(extra_i, extra_j), size=size):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Calling `propagate` initiates the message passing process. Looking at the function parameters, we highlight a couple of key parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `edge_index` is passed to the forward function and captures the edge structure of the graph.\n",
    "  - `x=(x_i, x_j)` represents the node features that will be used in message passing. In order to explain why we pass the tuple `(x_i, x_j)`, we first look at how our edges are represented. For every edge $(i, j) \\in {E}$, we can differentiate $i$ as the source or central node ($x_{central}$) and j as the neighboring node ($x_{neighbor}$).\n",
    "  \n",
    "    Taking the example of message passing above, for a central node $u$ we will aggregate and transform all of the messages associated with the nodes $v$ s.t. $(u, v) \\in {E}$ (i.e. $v \\in \\mathscr{N}_{u}$). Thus we see, the subscripts `_i` and `_j` allow us to specifcally differenciate features associated with central nodes (i.e. nodes  recieving message information) and neighboring nodes (i.e. nodes passing messages).\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is definitely a somewhat confusing concept; however, one key thing to remember / wrap your head around is that depending on the perspective, a node $x$ acts as a central node or a neighboring node. In fact, in undirected graphs we store both edge directions (i.e. $(i, j)$ and $(j, i)$). From the central node perspective, `x_i`, x is collecting neighboring information to update its embedding. From a neighboring node perspective, `x_j`, x is passing its message information along the edge connecting it to a different central node.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `extra=(extra_i, extra_j)` represents additional information that we can associate with each node beyond its current feature embedding. In fact, we can include as many additional parameters of the form `param=(param_i, param_j)` as we would like. Again, we highlight that indexing with `_i` and `_j` allows us to differentiate central and neighboring nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The output of the `propagate` function is a matrix of node embeddings after the message passing process and has shape $[N, d]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def message(x_j, ...):\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `message` function is called by propagate and constructs the messages from\n",
    "neighboring nodes $j$ to central nodes $i$ for each edge $(i, j)$ in *edge_index*. This function can take any argument that was initially passed to `propagate`. Furthermore, we can again differentiate central nodes and neighboring nodes by appending `_i` or `_j` to the variable name, .e.g. `x_i` and `x_j`. Looking more specifically at the variables, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `x_j` represents a matrix of feature embeddings for all neighboring nodes passing their messages along their respective edge (i.e. all nodes $j$ for edges $(i, j) \\in {E}$). Thus, its shape is $[|{E}|, d]$!\n",
    "  - In implementing GAT we will see how to access additional variables passed to propagate\n",
    "\n",
    "  Critically, we see that the output of the `message` function is a matrix of neighboring node embeddings ready to be aggregated, having shape $[|{E}|, d]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.\n",
    "```\n",
    "def aggregate(self, inputs, index, dim_size = None):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lastly, the `aggregate` function is used to aggregate the messages from neighboring nodes. Looking at the parameters we highlight:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `inputs` represents a matrix of the messages passed from neighboring nodes (i.e. the output of the `message` function).\n",
    "  - `index` has the same shape as `inputs` and tells us the central node that corresponding to each of the rows / messages $j$ in the `inputs` matrix. Thus, `index` tells us which rows / messages to aggregate for each central node.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The output of `aggregate` is of shape $[N, d]$.\n",

Now the question remains, what are the messages passed by each neighbor nodes and when do we call the `propagate` function?\n",
